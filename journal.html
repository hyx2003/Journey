      ID ,Bountiful UT, Last Chance ,CO, Why, AZ and Truth or Consequences, NM.

    <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:"Passing cars, When you can't see, May get you ,A glimpse, Of enternity
      ."I definitelyly won't be passing any cars.

    <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finalli got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring 
      a whole lot with me: cell phone, ipod, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles
      begins with one Segway."
