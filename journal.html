    <p>I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:</p>
    <blockquote>Passing cars,<br>
      When you can't see,<br>
      May get you ,<br>
      A glimpse,<br>
      Of enternity.<br></blockquote> 
      <p>I definitelyly won't be passing any cars.

    <p>My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finalli got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring 
      a whole lot with me: cell phone, ipod, digital camera, and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles
      begins with one Segway.</q>
